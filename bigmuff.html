                    In the early 70s, fuzz pedals were going through a big shift in design. Fuzz pedals were now using
                    cascading-circuit designs in which the harmonic qualies of the pedal were being magnified through a
                    feed back loop. This lead to extreme amounts of sustain giving a true wall of fuzz sound.

                    Electro-Harmonix created the Big Muff Pi and was designed by the co-founder Mike Matthews. The Big
                    Muff Pi uses four transitor stages resulting in the growl and aggressive sustain produced by the
                    pedal. This pedal has been a staple in my movements ranging from bands like The Black Keys, Dinasour
                    Jr, and the Smashing Pumpkins. Listen to “Thickfreakness” by the Black Keys to hear the sustain and
                    intersting tonal qualities the Big Muff Pi offers.
